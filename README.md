# mikrotik-scripts
 Mikrotik scripts (made for my specific use cases).

Scripts utilize RouterOS rest api (https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/REST+API). The authentication is done in a non secure way.
Works for my usecase. No error checks whatsoever. If you want to use it, make sure to read through it. Run at your own risk. Not responsible for any complaints from your users :)
